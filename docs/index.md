# App Development with Flutter

## Introduction
Welcome!
We are happy to introduce you to the newest offering of our semester program: the App Development Track!  Guiding you through your project will be Steffen Knödler. Steffen graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Economics & Business Administration from Goethe University. He holds a Master’s degree in IT and Digital innovation and has been working as a Full-Stack Flutter developer for more than 2 years. 

In this track you will be introduced to the platform framework Flutter. Why Flutter?  In the last year, Flutter has overtaken other tools and become the most popular toolkit for cross-platform mobile development. By February 2022, nearly 500,000 Flutter apps have already been published to the Google Play Store. Many large companies such as BMW, Alibaba, Philips and Google also develop apps based on Flutter and its community is growing. Like no other framework, Flutter offers the possibility to develop with one codebase (Dart).  Although the framework can be compiled for other platforms, such as web, macOS and Windows, this course will focus primarily on mobile app development, as it is very mature in mobile app development on Android and iOS.

Overall you will gain insight into the work of an app developer. Not only will you learn how to use Flutter but you will also make use of Android Studio, which is the official development environment for Google's open-source mobile operating system and was specifically created to give non-experts the opportunity to develop their own apps for the mobile operating system. Additionally you will get to know Android Emulators which make it possible to use the Android operating system on another operating system, for example Windows.

We are excited to see you make your very first app development steps and help you enable you to find the right resources to learn!



## Objectives
You will learn the basics of app development with Flutter and will be able to develop your own apps for iOS and Android. By the end of this course, you will be able to create a Flutter app with a variety of pages, enable navigation between pages, and customize widgets to meet requirements.

Flutter can be used to develop cross-platform apps in the Dart programming language. A Flutter program should be able to run on the following target platforms without major adjustments: WebApp, Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, macOS, and Google Fuchsia. Flutter itself is written in C++ and uses the Dart Virtual Machine (Dart VM), as well as the Skia graphics library. Differentiation from other frameworks One of the ways Flutter differs from other frameworks is that it does not use WebView or OEM widgets, which are pre-installed on the end device. When a Native App interacts with the platform to create a widget, it typically accesses the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) widgets on the smartphone or tablet. Flutter eliminates this intermediate step. Instead, the framework uses its own high-performance render engine, Skia, to create the necessary widgets. The open source graphics library for creating 2D graphics connects via interfaces with the respective existing, operating system-dependent, native software development kits. Flutter is executed using ahead-of-time compilers (AOT compilers). Only in the development phase, just-in-time compilers (JIT compilers) are used for faster testing processes. Each app based on Flutter is composed of container, text, image, icon and other widgets, which are individually interpreted and displayed on a canvas element powered by the Skia graphics library. The platform then analyzes the widgets constructed in this way and forwards the events provoked by the end user's interaction to the app. Architecture The framework is essentially constructed from three process units. Source: https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview Embedder At the lowest level and at the heart of the engine, platform-specific embedders are defined. Their job is to connect the rendering with the native screen information, input events, etc. For this purpose, the embedders interact with the engine layer via simple C/C++ APIs. However, these APIs are only mapped internally. This layer is composed of a shell, a human-machine interface, that hosts Dart's virtual machine (DartVM). This shell is platform-specific and provides access to the associated native APIs. They implement OS-specific code, such as communication with the app's Input Method Editor (IME) and lifecycle events. The actual architecture, however, consists of two elements: the engine and the framework. Engine Flutter's middle layer, written in C/C++, contains a variety of components that are crucial to the functionality of the framework and its basic operation. These include the Skia graphics engine and shells, which are accessed through APIs represented by the dart:ul library. Using the defined classes in this library, such as Canvas, Paint and TextBox, it is possible to visually design an app. Framework This is the most important layer that hosts all the libraries and packages necessary to develop an app. The framework is the component that is programmed in Dart and which you need to know. In this section, the operations for creating widgets, for instance, are located. You, as a developer, do not need to know much about the embedder and engine unit. To develop fast and beautiful apps, you only need to know the framework. In the FLutter framework, everything is a widget. A widget is a basic component in a Futter app, which in turn can itself consist of other widgets. A widget bundles logic, interaction, and presentation within an object.There are a number of pre-built widgets that map familiar and often needed interactions, such as buttons, lists, checkboxes, tabs, and so on. Flutter does not use the widgets of the respective platform, but implements them itself. Before we dive deeper into the flutter framework and its syntax, let us consider the programming language dart and its syntax. Dart Syntax \u200b\u200bDart is an open-source, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language with C-style syntax developed by Google in 2011. The purpose of Dart programming is to create a frontend user interface for the web and mobile apps. It is inspired by other programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, C#, and is Strongly Typed. Since Dart is a compiled language so you cannot execute your code directly; instead, the compiler parses it and transfers it into machine code. If you know javascript, dart is very easy to learn. Dart supports most of the common concepts of programming languages like classes, interfaces, and functions. You do not need to know dart in detail to build a flutter app. Actually, you can even pick up dart while learning flutter and you do not have to learn dart before. However, knowledge of the programming language will help you develop apps. Variables and Constants 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 main () { var dog1 = \"Max\" ; // this is a variable // a variable can be final, which means that it must be initialized. Once assigned a value, a final variable's value cannot be changed. final maleDogs = [ \"Milo\" ]; // mutable single-assignment variable maleDogs . add ( \"Cooper\" ); // \u2705 this is allowed (you can add an element to the list) maleDogs = [ \"Cooper\" ]; // \u274c this is not allowed (you cannot reassign the variable) const femaleDogs = [ \"Luna\" , \"Bella\" ]; // compile time constant femaleDogs . add ( \"Winona\" ); // \u274c this is not allowed (you cannot change the variable) femaleDogs = [ \"Winona\" ]; // \u274c this is not allowed } Null and Conditions In Dart, undefined values are null. Expressions in conditionals may only be boolean. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 main () { var collar = false , toys = null , amountOfMeals = 0 / 0 , // NaN owner = \"\" , age = 0 , breed ; if ( ! collar ) print ( 'bark' ); // bark (means: if not false \u2192 if true) // same as: if ( ! collar ) { print ( 'bark' );} // bark if ( toys == null ) print ( 'bark' ); // bark (checks if toys is null) if ( amountOfMeals . isNaN ) print ( 'bark' ); // bark if ( owner . isEmpty ) print ( 'bark' ); // bark (the string is empty) if ( age == 0 ) print ( 'bark' ); // bark (checks if age is zero) if ( breed == null ) print ( 'bark' ); // bark (checks if breed is null) } Collection literals An Array in Javascript is a List in Dart. An Object in Javascript is a Map in Dart. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 main () { var dogList = [ \"Lucy\" , \"Cooper\" , \"Zeus\" ]; var dogMap = { 'first' : \"Lucy\" , 'second' : \"Cooper\" }; // could use #first symbol instead var dogSet = { \"Lucy\" , \"Cooper\" , \"Zeus\" }; print ( dogList . length ); // 3 print ( dogMap . length ); // 2 print ( dogSet . length ); // 3 } Object-oriented Classes An Array in Javascript is a List in Dart. An Object in Javascript is a Map in Dart. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 class Dog { // Class \u201cDog\u201d final String name ; // variable name of type String final int phone ; // variable phone of type integer Dog ( this . name , { this . phone }); // example of unnamed and named parameter tag () => \" ${ name } \\n If you found me please call ${ phone } !\" ; } main () { print ( Dog ( 'Luna' , phone: 6198887421 ). tag ()); // Luna // If you found me please call 6198887421! } Flutter Syntax As soon as you create a new flutter project, the flutter \u201cHello-world\u201d project will be displayed. The Flutter hello-world project is a very simple counter app. You can press a button to increase the counter and the current count is displayed in the middle of the screen. We added the source code and our own comments to the guide to help you understand the minimum-viable app source code. Please read the comments carefully. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 // import flutter component import 'package:flutter/material.dart' ; // when run code, trigger the function main() // main runs the widget \u201cMyApp\u201d void main () => runApp ( MyApp ()); // 1.

However, knowledge of the programming language will help you develop apps.","title":"Dart Syntax"},{"location":"flutter/#variables-and-constants","text":"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 main () { var dog1 = \"Max\" ; // this is a variable // a variable can be final, which means that it must be initialized.

The app provides space for tech-academy related notes and offers easy and fast access to certain pages of the Tech-Academy website. To complete this course, you are asked to meet the defined requirements. The following requirement section is divided in two parts. First, the project user-stories are presented. In software development, a user story is an informal description of features of a software product. This type of feature description is commonly used in the industry. The user stories have one or multiple acceptance criteria attached. Second, the technical requirements are listed. To complete the project and pass this track, you are asked to fulfill all acceptance criteria as well as to meet all technical requirements. Requirements As a TechAcademy participant, I want to manage my own TechAcademy tasks in a Flutter app. To do that, I need six features. 1. Display notes (page 1) As a TechAcademy participant, I want to see all my previously written notes on a page. If I have saved my name on the profile page previously, I want to be welcomed by the app. Acceptance Criteria: All notes which have been added before, are visible. If no note has been saved so far, the text \"No note available\" is visible. If the user has added a name, the name is visible above the notes. 2. Adding Notes (page 2) As a TechAcademy participant, I want to have a page, on which I can submit a note title and note body text. As soon as the note is submitted, I want to see the saved note on page 1. Acceptance Criteria: A form field for the title is available A form field for the body text is available A save button is available When the button is clicked, the added text will be saved locally 3. Show Webview1 (page 3) As a TechAcademy participant, I want to have a page on which the website https://www.tech-academy.io/team/ is visible. The website should load as soon as I visit the page. Acceptance Criteria: When the page opens, the website https://www.tech-academy.io/team/ loads directly I can navigate on the website 4. Show Webview2 (page 4) As a TechAcademy participant, I want to have a page on which the website https://www.tech-academy.io/login/ is visible. The website should load as soon as I visit the page. Acceptance Criteria: When the page opens, the website https://www.tech-academy.io/login/ loads directly I can navigate on the website 5. Update first- and last name (page 5) As a TechAcademy participant, I want to have a page, on which I can update my first- and last name. Both items should have an individual text field. The first and last name should only be updatable if both text fields have at least two characters entered. Only letters should be allowed to enter. As soon as the names are saved, I want to see the text \u201cHello\u201d, followed by the recently saved first- and last name above my previously saved notes. Acceptance Criteria: A form field for the first name is available A form field for the second name is available A save button is available When the button is clicked, the first name and last name will be saved locally When a name is saved, the saved name is visible above my notes 6. Having a Bottom-Navigation-bar As a TechAcademy participant, I want to always have a bottom navigation bar visible. The navigation bar should have 5 buttons. Each button should take me to one of the pages.
